# A website that showcases custom-made cakes :cake: :cake: :cake:
## Built with React JS

**Notes** 

-Used HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter in the index.js file because BrowserRouter does not work well with Github Pages and was causing errors on hard refereshes on pages that are not the root Routes.

-Images in Public folder were not showing, fixed by using relative path.

**For reference**
